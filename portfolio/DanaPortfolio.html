<h1>About me</h1>
<img src="profileportfolio.jpg" alt="picture of Dana" width="180" height="250">
<p>My name is Dana Felixon, I am 18 years old and I am participating at the Girls Who Code program this summer.</p>

<p>I am from Haiti and I came to the United States about 10 months ago. I am a rising junior at Boston International Newcomers Academy and I would like to be able to understand computer very well since the technology is the most important thing nowadays.</p>
<h2> This is a screenshot of my Side Scroller game from last week.</h2>
<img src="tacoflap.PNG" alt="Scratch game" width="104" height="142">
<p>Tacoflap is a game that my partner programming, Cindy and I created on scratch.
  It's like the game flappy bird but only a taco instead of the bird. Every time the taco touches the tree or the rain, it gets bitten and the game is over.
  You use the space button to make it move.</p>

<h4>A fun fact</h4>
<p>A fun fact is that I am not really a fan of computers but I chose to go to a summer program to learn about computers.</p>
<p>I like to read, my favorite food is pizza, I love cats and I love playing the piano.</p>
